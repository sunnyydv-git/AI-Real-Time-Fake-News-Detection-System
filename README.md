A scalable, end-to-end real-time fake news detection pipeline powered by Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Streaming, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Streamlit, and Hugging Face Transformers. This project detects fake or real news from streaming sources in real time and stores predictions in a cloud/local database for downstream analysis.
